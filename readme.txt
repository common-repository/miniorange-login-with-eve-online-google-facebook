= WordPress Single Sign-On / SSO ( Login to WordPress ) =

WordPress Single Sign-On (WordPress SSO) allows users to log into any website/application using the single set of credentials of another app/site through the SSO feature.
**Example:**Let’s say you have all your users/customers/members/employees stored on a site, called ‘site A’ and you want all of them to register/login using WordPress SSO to your WordPress site called ‘site B’. In this scenario, you can register/login all your users of site A into site B using the login credentials/account of site A. This is called Single Sign-On or SSO, and it simplifies user management through SSO.

= WordPress Single Sign-On ( WordPress SSO ) supported Third-Party Application / OAuth OpenID Provider =
* The Third-Party Application can be anything where user accounts are stored or a site/application where you want to store/migrate all the users. It can be your social login app, WordPress site, OAuth provider, OpenID provider, custom provider or any database.
* Applications/providers such as OAuth Identity Provider, OAuth Server, OpenID Connect Server, OpenID Connect Provider, and OIDC Application support Single Sign-On (SSO). SSO integration ensures smooth user authentication and management across these platforms.

OAuth and OpenID Connect are token-based Single Sign-On (SSO) protocols that allow an end user's account information to be used by third-party services without exposing the user's password.

The SSO plugin supports OAuth 1.0, OAuth 2.0, and OAuth 2.1, along with the latest OAuth and OpenID Connect protocols. It includes secure 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) if enabled by the provider. These industry-standard protocols enable seamless WordPress SSO, providing a good SSO experience for your WordPress site.

= WordPress Single Sign-On ( WordPress SSO ) USE CASES =

* Single Sign On (SSO) to one/multiple WordPress site (single/multisite) using User Credentials stored on another WordPress site with WordPress SSO plugin.
* Single Sign On (SSO) to one/multiple WordPress site (single / multisite) using User Credentials stored on your OAuth / OpenID Connect (OIDC) application with WordPress SSO plugin.
* Single Sign On ( WordPress SSO ) into WordPress using existing User stores (Active Directory/Database)
* SSO and extended plugin functionality using tokens (access_token / JWT token / id_token) such as secure API calls using third-party token
* Others: eCommerce Single Sign On (SSO)/Login & other third-party integration with SSO features

**Microsoft SSO/Azure SSO**

This WordPress Single Sign-On (OAuth / OpenID Connect SSO) plugin supports SSO with Microsoft apps like Azure AD, Azure B2C, Office 365, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, Microsoft Teams, and Windows Live. It also supports policy-based login redirections, including sign-up, sign-in, forgot password, and custom policies, enhancing the SSO experience across Microsoft services.

WordPress integrates with Microsoft services like Azure AD, Azure B2C, and Office 365 for secure Single Sign-On (SSO) across single-site and multisite networks (including subdomains). Users can perform single sign-on (SSO), map profile attributes, and manage role-based access across applications and tenants using SSO

Apart from Single Sign-On (SSO), it also supports WordPress-Azure integrations and customizations, such as token-based calls to specific APIs and the Microsoft Graph API, enhancing the Single Sign On (SSO) experience

**Cognito SSO**

The WordPress Single Sign-On (SSO) plugin supports Login with AWS Cognito, Amazon, and WordPress using Cognito. It provides user profile syncing, role mapping, and token fetching from AWS Cognito for API calls.

SSO provides hooks for using Keycloak access tokens, allowing WordPress to make REST calls to remote services with these tokens. The OAuth/OIDC SSO plugin also supports role-based access control (RBAC) by mapping WordPress roles to Keycloak roles and capabilities enhancing the Single Sign-On (SSO) experience.

**Ping Federate SSO**
The WordPress SSO (OAuth / OpenID Connect SSO) plugin enables Login to WordPress using PingFederate. It supports Single Sign-On (SSO) with authorized access to Ping REST APIs via access tokens or bearer tokens, ensuring seamless SSO integration and secure interactions with PingFederate.
